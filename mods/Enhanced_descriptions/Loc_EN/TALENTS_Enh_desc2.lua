			-- ============ DO NOT DO ANYTHING ABOVE! ============ --

-- Check the length of the text in the game and adjust it so that the descriptions do not extend the card beyond the screen.
-- If you can't shorten it, you can simply hide the least useful line by adding "--" before that line.
-- Extended descriptions have a lower priority than the main description, imho.

-- If you added/changed something, then you need to duplicate/change the same entry in the list below.
-- For example, you change "ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb" to "ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb_urlang", then at the bottom you need to find (CTRL+F) the "ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb" entries and also rename them from "ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb = ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb," to "ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb_urlang = ED_VET_Blitz_0_rgb_urlang,".
-- If you add a new entry (ex. MyEntry_rgb), just duplicate it in the list below (MyEntry_rgb = MyEntry_rgb,).
